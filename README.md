# IOTassignment
A university assignment that I created for the internet of things unit.
There are 2 sections of this project, an java application and a mobile application. The project uses sensors and
IOT technologies to move/control a motor(To simulate a key fob opening a door lock). The project also uses both a physical 
slider and a slider on the mobile app to change a stored value. The values are read from and stored onto a mySQL database using JSON.

I have a report on the project or those who are interested.
